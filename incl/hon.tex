\begin{description}
\item[2021]Awarded Distinguished Talent Residency by Govt of Australia for contributions to Australian and international projects in the energy sector.

\item[2019]Service Recognition Award, Shell Australia for enabling the concept of a fixed offshore structure in 170m in challenging design conditions (calcareous soils) and prevailing geo-hazards, with robustness to pass Decision Gate 3.

\item[2018]Recognition (\textsc{calm} buoy replacement, offloading), \textsc{bsp} for design maturation and assurance of the buoy incl. hydrodynamics, mooring and riser interfaces, \textsc{qa}/\textsc{qc} and \textsc{fat}, post-fabrication quayside ballast and trim tests.

\item[2017]Recognition (drilling, remote flaring), Qatar Shell for championing new technology, product development and maturation, viz., employing smoothed particle hydrodynamics in remote flare buoy design (flaring, station-keeping) in extreme low wind conditions.

% \item[2016]Recognition (Brownfield, Blast design), Sakhalin Energy for developing a lean structure to host new emergency power generation within \textsc{paa} platform's congested layout, and designing it to withstand blast over-pressures, saving 67\% of contractor-proposed tonnage, minimising impact to the supporting box girder deck, and simplifying offshore construction activity.

\item[2013]Service Recognition Award (drilling, conductor repair), Shell Malaysia for engineering and execution of novel and low cost conductor repairs at \textsc{sfdpa} platform.

% \item[2012]Recognition (Fabrication, Troubleshooting), Shell Malaysia for mitigating fabrication challenges for difficult-to-access eight lift safety critical welding joints in E8K and F13K compression modules, 1,800t each.

\item[2011]Recognition (turret-mooring), Shell \textsc{p\&t} for (a) the maturation of Floating \textsc{lng}'s (weather-vaning) turret-mooring concept, and response-based mooring design for application in harsh cyclonic environment, (b) turret size optimisation, and (c) for developing a qualification process for the largest polyester rope for station-keeping for ultra-deepwater applications.

\item[2005]Recognition (catamaran float over a \textsc{spar}), Murphy Oil Malaysia for developing and designing Kikeh topsides for the catamaran tow to mate with Asia's first deepwater truss-\textsc{spar}.

% \item[2001]Recognition (Execution of two lean fixed offshore platforms), ExxonMobil Malaysia for the optimized design of Bintang A and B platforms.

\item[2000]Recognition (integrity assessment post well-blowout), Unocal for evaluating and mitigating foundation reliability from well-blowout event at \textsc{ewe} platform.
